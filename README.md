🧠 Overview

This project implements an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that turns any PDF into an interactive AI assistant.

Users can upload a PDF, automatically index its content, and ask questions — receiving answers grounded strictly in the document with citations.

This is the same architecture used by:

ChatGPT Retrieval Plugins

Google’s Enterprise Search

Notion AI Q&A

ChatPDF
